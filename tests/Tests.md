# Tests
I wanted to make sure that the tweaks preserved original behavior.  What I ended up with isn't the ideal way of testing a project.  But as the original code is a series of simple programs this was the best compromise that came to me.

The tests are using Catch [https://github.com/philsquared/Catch]().  I picked Catch as it is contained within a header file.  As opposed to something like Google Test, which has a library dependency.
