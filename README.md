# APIBookTweaks
Tweaks to examples from  API Design for C++ book.

Dec 30, 2016

The following are certain examples from Martin Reddy's API Design For C++ book.  The all of the original examples from the book can be found at: http://APIBook.com.

The original examples are prepared nicely and are set up to build under cmake.  I hope to also include the needed files to have them build under cmake, too.
